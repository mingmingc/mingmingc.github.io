                Hi! I'm a Bay Area native, now a full-stack web development student at UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. I love to code and look forward to becoming a web developer. <br> 
                I studied Psychology in college and have found that while I have chosen another career path, <br>
                I find that my interest in understanding and interacting with people has not left me, and never will.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm an INFJ. My hobbies include napping, weight lifting,
                yoga, reading, hiking, camping, drawing, painting, playing the piano, and cooking. <br> 
                I practice mindfulness and meditation daily.
            </p>

            <p>
                Enjoy the content here on my portfolio - I know I enjoyed creating all of it :) 
            </p>
