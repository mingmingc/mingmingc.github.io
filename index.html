            Hi! I'm a Bay Area native, now a full stack web development student at UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. I love to code and look forward to becoming a web developer. <br> 
            I studied Psychology in college and have found that while I have chosen another career path, <br>
            I find that my interest in understanding and interacting with people has not left me, and never will.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm an INFJ. My hobbies include napping, weight lifting,
            yoga, reading, hiking, camping, drawing, painting, playing the piano, and cooking. <br> 
            To take care of myself, I practice mindfulness and meditation daily.
        </p>

        <p>
            Enjoy the content here on my portfolio - I know I enjoyed creating all of it :)
