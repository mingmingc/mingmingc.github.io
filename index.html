                Minging Caressi is a Bay Area native, now a full-stack web development student at UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. I love to code and look forward to becoming a web developer. <br> 
                I studied Psychology at Lewis & Clark College and have found that while I have chosen another career path, <br>
                I find that my interest in understanding and interacting with people has not left me, and never will.

                My hobbies include napping, weight lifting,
                yoga, reading, hiking, camping, drawing, painting, playing the piano, and cooking. <br> 
                I practice mindfulness and meditation daily.
