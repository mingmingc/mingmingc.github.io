                        <p> <h3 class ="is-3"> I am an adaptive, full-stack savvy front-end developer. 
                        I strive to build immersive and thoughtful web applications with clean code and user-centric design in mind. </h2></p> 
                        <br><br>
                        <p> I graduated with a B.A. in Psychology from Lewis & Clark College in 2015. I initially went into college to become a clinical psychologist.
                        However, I took my first computer programming class ever as a senior and fell in love, realizing I also had a natural knack for it. 
                        I discovered that I could still pursue my dream of reforming healthcare by working in digital health. </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p> Now, I am a Junior Software Developer recently graduated from UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp in 2019. I specialize in the MERN Stack 
                        (Mongo, Express, React, Node) to build fully immersive full-stack apps. I enjoy discovering new ways that React makes apps that are
                        both more immediately rewarding and informative to the customer, while also putting less burden on developers to give and get updates from the 
                        server to the front-end. I have a big-picture outlook on projects and this, combined with my collaborative nature and penchant to lead,
                        has caused me to find myself in the role of project manager on several group projects. I would oversee merges, meeting deadlines, 
                        and meeting the needs of our MVP or target features. </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p> When not online, I can be found in Redwood City in my community home, exploring California with my parents and twin brother,
                            visiting museums, hiking to swimming holes, or snuggling up with our house cat, Margarita. 
                        </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p> Enjoy the content on this page. I know I enjoyed creating all of it :) </p>
