                    <h2> Front-end & Full Stack Developer</h2> 
                    
                    I'm a adaptive and conscientious full-stack web developer, specializing in the MERN Stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node). 
                    I builds apps with user friendliness in mind. I love building with React

                    Since graduating with a B.A. in Communication from Trinity University in 2007, Kathryn has focused her professional career 
                    almost exclusively on Drupal development.

                    She is a Senior Software Developer at Express Scripts and specializes in Drupal's front-end.

                    In addition to her development work, Kathryn is a long-time member of the North American DrupalCon Program Team and 
                    has served on the front-end track for Austin ('14), Los Angeles ('15), New Orleans ('16), and Baltimore ('17).

                    When not online, Kathryn can be found in Austin, Texas with her husband, Andrew, and young son—searching for the perfect 
                    vintage items for their home, trying out a new recipe in the kitchen, experimenting in gardening, or snuggling with their two dogs, Jackson and Pan.
