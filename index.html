                        I am an adaptive, full-stack savvy front-end developer. 
                        I strive to build immersive and thoughtful web applications with clean code and user-centric design in mind.

                        both more immediately rewarding and informative to the customer, while also putting less burden on developers to give and get updates from the 
                        server to the front-end.
    
                        In addition to my developer work, I
